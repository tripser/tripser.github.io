We are very excited to share with you our two weeks in Croatia and Montenegro. We had a great time discovering the beautiful landscapes, the stunning coast and the island of Mljet. We also enjoyed the delicious food and the warm hospitality of the locals.

## Arrival in Kotor

After landing at the airport, we could pick our rental car without any issues. We left Croatia's territory after a bit of time queuing at the border and landed in Montenegro. We quickly had our breath taken away with the **bay of Kotor**.

A scenic drive brought us to <MdxLink href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/me/vila-sofija-kotor.html">Vila Sofija</MdxLink>, where we checked in and settled into our first home. That evening, we stayed in, enjoying a wonderful view on the water and a quiet homemade dinner with local ingredients — a perfect start.

## Kotor's Old Town Charm and Bay Views

Kotor greeted us with its timeless **Old Town**, where massive ferries loomed beyond the fortified walls. We climbed to the **Church of St. Giovanni**, rewarded with panoramic views over the bay. For lunch, we hesitated a lot to pick a restaurant and eventually stumbled upon **Pescaria Dekaderon**, a cozy place nestled within the stone alleys.

In the afternoon, we found tranquility at **Galebova Beach**, sipping cocktails at the **Bianco Bar** right by the water. Dinner was a peaceful affair back at home, a fitting end to a full day.

## Trail in Lovćen and Coastal Evening

We set off for **Lovćen National Park**, hiking to the **Mausoleum of Njegoš** perched atop **Jezerski Peak**. The trail and views were invigorating, and we refueled with lunch at the summit.

On the drive back, we stopped for a drink at the clifftop **Horizont Bar**, then cooled off with a dip at **Dobrota Beach**. That evening, we dined at **Restaurant Barba**, right by the water — grilled perfection paired with golden hour views.

## Dubrovnik, City of Stone and panoramas

We bid farewell to Kotor and headed north to **Dubrovnik**. Our host at <MdxLink href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/hr/bed-and-breakfast-villa-klaic.html">Villa Klaic</MdxLink> welcomed us with a cold beer and insider tips. After a pleasant lunch overlooking the fortress walls, we wandered through the **Old Town** and along the bustling docks.

A break at **Buža Bar**, perched on the cliff’s edge, offered quite nice sea views. We climbed up to **Panorama Restaurant** for cocktails above the city and this time we couldn't believe the panorama we had in front of us.

Back down in the old town, we savored fresh fish at **Lucin Kantun**, followed by celebratory beers at **The Gaffe**, a local Irish pub as there seems to be in every city.

## Arriving on Mljet

After an early drive leaving Dubrovnik to reach **Prapratno**, we boarded the ferry to **Sobra** on **Mljet Island**. The boat ride went smoothly and we could have lunch at a seaside pizzeria.

Later, we explored the legendary **Odysseus Cave**, which wasn't so great to our opinion. We could find better spots once inside the **Mljet National Park**, and its beautiful lakes. We arrived at <MdxLink href="https://www.mljetferien.com/english/index.html">Villa Bjelac</MdxLink>, where we had booked a half-pension guesthouse from the Routard guide.

> If there is one stay to recommand, this is the one. It is greatly located, cute, comfortable and very handy with the half-board option.

Our hosts prepared a delicious fish dish for dinner, a simple yet perfect end to the day.

## Pomena, walks and Lakeside Swims

We hiked through the national park to **Pomena**, where we had a hearty steak lunch at **Agroturizam Dalmatino**, a charming rustic spot.

The afternoon brought a walk back along the north shore and a swim in the **Malo Jezero**. Another delicious freshly fished fish dinner awaited us back in Soline.

## Prožurska Luka and Okuklje

A morning drive led us to **Prožurska Luka**, where we swam in turquoise waters under the sun. Afterward, we explored **Okuklje**, though it didn't quite live up to expectations.

A late lunch near the **Veliko Jezero** sustained us, and that night we enjoyed tender squid for dinner.

## Montokuc and St. Mary Island

We hiked to **Montokuc**, the island’s high point, for a 360° view of the archipelago.

We caught a boat to **St. Mary Island**, wandering around the monastery and lunching on seaside snacks. Another boat took us to a small lake where we swam before catching the boat back and a quirky little train back. Yes, more fish for dinner — and never tired of it.

  ]}
/>

## Trogir and Skradin

We left Mljet, ferrying back to the coast and driving toward **Skradin**. Along the way, we stopped for a picnic on a random beach.

We explored the charming town of **Trogir**, enjoying drinks at a beautiful café. By evening, we arrived in Skradin and settled into <MdxLink href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/hr/studio-apartment-skatula.en-gb.html">Skatula Studio</MdxLink>, ending with a pasta dinner at home.

## Krka's Waterfall Wonderland

We took an early boat from Skradin to the **Krka National Park** and could enjoy the views on the water. After a few minutes, we could wander and admire the **Skradinski Buk** and other falls, all framed by lush greenery.

> Skradin is a great starting point to reach the **Krka National Park**. We suggest leaving early to avoid the masses.

Later, we drove to **Manojlovac Waterfall**, a peaceful trail leading to spectacular views.

After a picnic and swim at **Roški Slap**, we made a final scenic stop at **Visovac Monastery** before heading home for a relaxed salad dinner.

## Split for the Day

A late start gave us just enough time to reach **Split**, where we wandered through the old town, explored the market and cathedral, then grabbed pre-lunch drinks before feasting on **tuna steak at Gregolevante**.

An afternoon stroll in **Marjan Park** capped the city visit before heading back to Skradin. We closed the night with pizza at **More i Prstaci**.

## Šibenik and Korala Beach

On our way to **Plitvice** area, we stopped at the **St. Michael Fortress** in **Šibenik**, then drove to **Korala Beach** near Novigrad for a dip and lunch.

Upon reaching <MdxLink href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/hr/villa-waterfalls.html">Villa Waterfalls Plitvice</MdxLink>, we dined nearby on juicy burgers from **Fast Food BBQ** — rustic but mouthwatering.

## Plitvice's Waterfalls and Lakes

A full day of nature immersion in the **Plitvice National Park**. We explored the **Upper Lakes**, with their wooden paths and lush green surrounds.

We could then descend to the **Lower Lakes**, where waterfalls gushed and mist kissed the air. What a souvenir that is.

> Once again, the earlier the better. Arrive in Plitvice at the opening time to enjoy the park with less people.

Lunch broke up the day, and we ended with an **apéro on the terrace** before enjoying a delicious final meal at **Restaurant Degenija**.

## Zadar and Nin

Our last day took us to **Nin** for one last beach swim, then onward to **Zadar**. We explored the center, treated ourselves to ice cream, and watched the **sunset over the sea**.

A farewell dinner of pasta brought the trip to a delicious close. Our home for the night: <MdxLink href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/hr/sky-amp-sun-lux-rooms.html">Sky & Sun Luxury Rooms</MdxLink> — a fitting name for the end of a sun-soaked adventure.
