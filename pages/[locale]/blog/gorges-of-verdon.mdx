We are very motivated to share with you an exciting journey through the breathtaking Gorges of Verdon, often referred to as the "Grand Canyon of Europe." Nestled in the heart of Provence, France, this stunning natural wonder is renowned for its turquoise waters, towering cliffs, and picturesque landscapes.

Join us as we embark on a memorable adventure, starting from Brussels and making our way to the charming village of Castellane. We'll share our experiences of camping at the relaxing Sandaya campsite, exploring the quaint village, and discovering the scenic routes and viewpoints that make the Gorges of Verdon a must-visit destination.

## Discovering the camping and Castellane

Everything started taking the road from Brussels to the Gorges of Verdon. We reached Castellane where we could join our camping. It's called Sandaya and we opted for a <MdxLink href="https://www.sandaya.fr/nos-campings/domaine-du-verdon/nos-locations/10">fancy cottage</MdxLink>. After settling in we did a small tour of the village. It is a small village with a great old town.

We then chilled our evening at the camping, playing games with an apero and a nice dinner. The camping is very nice and fancy, not crowded at all in June. The cottage is comfortable for two, has everything we need and even a grill for the meat.

## Right shore and its Route des Crêtes

On this new day we discovered how strange the weather would be for the week: Clear and sunny in the morning but heavy rains in the afternoon. Waking up early and focus on the morning for our activities will be the way to go.

We went for a drive from the right shore of the Gorges of Verdon where we could see amazing views from the many, many belvederes in the route des crêtes. We took the opportunity to visit the small and <MdxLink href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rtnTH9gg2XDmXXdw6">cute village of Rougon</MdxLink> and to enjoy the views at the point sublime.

We experienced lunch in the village of la Palud sur Verdon with a great chicken and fries at <MdxLink href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NEENt7LQ9zGeT4dq7">Joe le snacky</MdxLink>. Back at the camp, we chilled, swam a bit in the beautiful pool and settled for a slow evening on the terrace.

## Castellane and the Roc

We went to Castellane again to really visit it. After a nice tour of the village and its old town, we went on climbing towards the Tour du Roc with the church. It was a nice hike and an even better view once on top of the Roc.

Back at the camp we chilled, and covered from the partial rain while planning for the rest of the week.

## Blanc-Martel trail from auberge la Maline

We woke up earlier to be fully ready for the <MdxLink href="https://www.alltrails.com/fr/randonnee/france/alpes-de-haute-provence/sentier-blanc-martel-gorge-du-verdon">famous Blanc-martel trail</MdxLink> described as a difficult hike. We joined our taxi and started from the chalet la maline.

> It's not a loop so you need to plan your way back. We opted for a taxi to get us towards the auberge.

We had a blast hiking in these views of the Verdon turquoise water and great cliffs surrounding us. The difficulty wasn't that high and we got lucky with the weather. Great walk, very well maintained.

Back at the camp we swam a bit and then played an Unlock escape game.

## In the water with canoe kayak

This day we went for a morning of <MdxLink href="https://www.raftsession.com/canoe-verdon-gorges-castellane/demi-journee/">canoe kayak in the Verdon</MdxLink>. We were quite good at it and enjoyed it a lot. The group was friendly and the views great. A bit of sport through some rapids made it very good.

We spent another afternoon full of resting at the camping because of the weather playing some card game.

## Castillon's Lake and camping activities

We planned a very chill day starting with the visit of <MdxLink href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/SQX4oDrhEMYgumy5A">Castillon's Lake</MdxLink>. It's very beautiful and colorful and offers a nice short walk to see it from different breathtaking points of view.

We played the mini golf the camping has for a bit of competition and also fought playing ping-pong.

## Imbut's trail from auberge des Cavaliers

Before changing location, we made another famous hike in the Verdon. <MdxLink href="https://www.alltrails.com/fr/randonnee/france/alpes-de-haute-provence/sentier-de-l-imbut">The Imbut trail</MdxLink> is a very beautiful one, with a changing parkour close to the water. The end was a mix of rain and storm which turned out somehow to be fun and made us running.

Back at the camp we could chill once again and rest from the walk and the week.

## Left shore through Trigance, Aiguines and Bauduen beach, Sainte-Croix's lake

We left the camping and took the road by the left of the Verdon. The weather was incredible and we visited Trigance and Aiguines villages. We went closer to Sainte-Croix's lake to eat at Les-Salles-sur-Verdon in the fancy restaurant <MdxLink href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/yotzPaqtaf5MS4CNA">Le côté Lac</MdxLink>.

{/* link bookin */}
Arrived at our new place, we discovered a great view on Bauduen's side of the lake. We went for a great swim at Bauduen beach which was a bit cold despite the big sun. We ended the day with a drink on the lake.

## Moustier-Sainte-Marie and pedalos in the Verdon

Our very last day started with a visit of <MdxLink href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/siCtYiu4sTiDK8ZeA">Moustier-Sainte-Marie</MdxLink>, a very beautiful village with views and old streets and shops. We went to the top to see the view and a church and once back down sat at a restaurant for a disappointing meal.

We then went to the lake near Bauduen and rented pedalos in the gorgeous Gorges of Verdon from the water. We ended the day going for burgers at <MdxLink href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/yPr6dXbTPfEfBwfv5">l'o à la bouche</MdxLink> with an amazing view on the lake.
